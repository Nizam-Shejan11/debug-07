      <h1>
        Question-1:- Difference between local storage and seassion storage??
      </h1>
      <p>
        <h3>Answer:</h3> sessionStorage is similar to localStorage ; the difference is
        that while data in localStorage doesn't expire, data in sessionStorage
        is cleared when the page session ends. Whenever a document is loaded in
        a particular tab in the browser, a unique page session gets created and
        assigned to that particular tab.

      <h1>Question-2:- Difference between global scope and block scope??</h1>
      <p>
        <h3>Answer:</h3> In a browser environment, the global scope is controlled by the
        window object while in Node. js, it's controlled by the global object.
        Block scopes are what you get when you use if statements, for
        statements, and the like.

      <h1>Question-3:- How to work javascript event loop??</h1>
      <p>
        <h3>Answer:</h3> The Event Loop has one simple job â€” to monitor the Call Stack
        and the Callback Queue. If the Call Stack is empty, the Event Loop will
        take the first event from the queue and will push it to the Call Stack,
        which effectively runs it. Such an iteration is called a tick in the
        Event Loop.

      <h1>Question-4:- How do I get undefined in JavaScript?</h1>
      <p>
        <h3>Answer:</h3> You will get undefined value when you call a non-existent
        property or method of an object. In the above example, a function Sum
        does not return any result but still we try to assign its resulted value
        to a variable. So in this case, result will be undefined.
